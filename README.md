What is ERC 20 Token?
ERC-20 tokens are a type of cryptocurrency built on the Ethereum Blockchain. They are digital tokens that can represent anything from shares in a company to virtual assets in a game.

How to deploy ERC 20.
MetaMask
Create your MetaMask wallet (get the wallet address).
In MetaMask go to setting then connect to Goreli Test-network.
At the moment you will not have any GoreliETH, so we need to mine it. images 05 07 2023_15 18 40_REC

Connect it with your Metamask account and start mining.
When you reach 0.01 then stop mining and collect the reward to you Metamask account.
